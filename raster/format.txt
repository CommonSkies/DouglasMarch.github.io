The first four lines of fvegMOD15A2.txt are a header.  Dimension 0 is
the y dimension and dimension 1 is the x dimension.  The remaining
values are fractional vegetation coverage (0% < fveg < 100%) in each
column from west to east, repeating in rows from north to south.

Special fill values indicate the following land use/land cover:
255 = MODIS surface reflectance for visible and near-infrared assigned
	  its fill value or land cover pixel itself assigned a fill value
