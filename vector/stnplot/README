The text information in world_us_country.mapdata is not trivial to read and use
in a Python program.  Here, you can convert the data file into much simpler
Python objects within a single dictionary.  Then pickle the dictionary using
cPickle.  You can load the dictionaries and use them instantly in Python 
programs.

To begin with this task, first pickle the map data with:
blizzard> ./picklemap.py world_us_country.mapdata

Next, make a plot in the file map.eps using:
blizzard> ./stnplot.py

View the map with:
blizzard> gv map.eps &

Convert the map to a raster image and view it with:
blizzard> convert +antialias map.eps map.png
blizzard> eog map.png &

See the comments within and at the end of stnplot.py to complete
your assignment.
