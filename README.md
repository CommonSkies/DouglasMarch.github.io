This is the completed works of my summer course on Advanced Concepts in Computer Applications. 
A few things to note about the codes:
   - The html indexed site was not meant to be advanced looking; I can program, not graphic design.
   - The Google API keys to the client maps are broken and I will relearn how to fix them if that skill is needed in the future. For now, I know GIS and that works much better. 
   - Python 2.0 and should be updated to 3.0 with new configuration when possible. 

A lot of the codes are from Dr. Christopher Godfrey at UNCA so he takes full credit for where his work is noted. Much of the works are pre-written and changed by me.
