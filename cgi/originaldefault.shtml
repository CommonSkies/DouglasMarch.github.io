To complete this assignment, improve <tt>wxplot.cgi</tt> to accomplish the following:
<ul>
  <li> Plot more than one day of data (i.e., from a "start date" to an "end date") with the dates chosen by the user
  <li> Overlay the time series for temperature at two specified stations
  <li> Plot multiple variables from the same site on the same plot (e.g., temperature and dewpoint)
</ul>
Then clean up your page to make it somewhat attractive and useful. Be creative.
These instructions are repeated in the comments within <tt>wxplot.cgi</tt>.

Below is the output from <tt>userenv.cgi</tt>, executed through the use of
an <tt>#include virtual</tt> statement directly within the HTML source.
Look for <tt>REMOTE_ADDR</tt> and <tt>HTTP_USER_AGENT</tt> and notice how you compromise your privacy simply by accessing the server!
